# The project
This project was for my bachelor graduation from the University of M'Sila
Me and my partners passed with 15.5/20 because we didn't have enough time to finish a few elements of the app as we are beginners, however I am very proud of it 


# What is it about? 
It's basically a mini version for the Algerian Health Record Booklet, and maybe in the future it could be a replacement.
